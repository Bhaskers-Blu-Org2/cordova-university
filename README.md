Six years ago, PhoneGap (a.k.a. Apache Cordova) burst onto the scene with tremendous fanfare. It promised near-total code sharing across iOS, Android, and Windows using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since then, both the technology and the market have matured. Phones are faster and JavaScript frameworks are smarter. Ionic Framework is a free and open source library of mobile-optimized HTML, CSS and JS CSS components, gestures, and tools for building highly interactive apps. Built with Sass and optimized for AngularJS, it fits neatly into the JS developer workflow. In this session, the Ionic team will join us on stage to share how Microsoft and Ionic built a Build conference app using VS Code, Visual Studio, Azure Mobile Services, Ionic and Code Push.

### Mobile DevOps (at a web cadence)

Technologies like PhoneGap, Cordova, and React Native brought the web's enviable edit-launch-debug cycle to mobile. While this makes for an amazing dev experience, your app ultimately distributes through the App Store… which means that you can’t take advantage of the same release agility often associated with web development. Or can you?

Whether developing locally, distributing internally, or publishing to the world, delivering updates on a “web cadence” improves your chances of success. This talk will show how easy it can be to setup an automated build pipeline and release continous app deployments via services like VSTS, HockeyApp and CodePush.
